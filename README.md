    • Visiting<br/>

For each task, you can create your own filters, which have many parameters, here are some of them:<br/>
    • OnlyNoPrivateProfile - If true, then interaction only with users who have uploaded a profile picture<br/>
    • OnlyNoFollowed - If true, then the interaction will occur only with profiles that you are not subscribed to<br/>
    • FollowersRange - The minimum and maximum number of followers to start interaction<br/>
    • FollowingsRange - The minimum and maximum number of followings to start interaction<br/>
    • PostsRange - The minimum and maximum number of posts to start interaction<br/>
