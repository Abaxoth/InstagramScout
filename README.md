- Visiting

For each task, you can create your own filters, which have many parameters, here are some of them:<br/>
- OnlyNoPrivateProfile - If true, then interaction only with users who have uploaded a profile picture<br/>
- OnlyNoFollowed - If true, then the interaction will occur only with profiles that you are not subscribed to<br/>
- FollowersRange - The minimum and maximum number of followers to start interaction<br/>
- FollowingsRange - The minimum and maximum number of followings to start interaction<br/>
- PostsRange - The minimum and maximum number of posts to start interaction<br/>

To set up filters, just use the familiar [PoE Official Trade](https://www.pathofexile.com/trade/search), then copy and paste the link into the app to track price changes.<br/>
